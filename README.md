# pacman.github.io

## PacMan Clone
###### Version 0.1

This project was created to practice animation in JavaScript, as well as to incorporate user interaction with the on screen characters.

#### Documentation

In this version, when the user loads the page PacMan will immediately start moving from left to right, and back again, across the screen. When the script is loaded it captures the size of the window then adjusts the maximum distance PacMan can travel horizontally across the screen.

#### Installation

This program requires pacman.html, PacMan1.png, PacMan2.png, PacMan3.png, and PacMan4.png to be in the same directory.

#### Usage

Open pacman.html in the browser.

#### Roadmap

PacMan will eventually be controlled by the user. The PacMan images will be replaced with a different character. A point system will be added. Finally, this will become a multiplayer mini-game in the browser.

#### Version Information

This application will be updated infrequently and the version numbers will follow this format:

                <major>.<minor>

Any major realease may alter the design and functionality of the application. 

Minor releases may include bug fixes, typographical errors, or minor restyling of on-screen elements.
